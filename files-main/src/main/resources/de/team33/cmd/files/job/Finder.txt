    %2$s find PATTERN PATH [PATH [...]]

    ... to find files whose file names match a specific search pattern.

Parameters:

    PATTERN - Consists of [METHOD[/OPTION]:]VALUE
              METHOD - One of {rx, wc} (case-insensitive)
                       rx : the VALUE is treated as a regular expression.
                       wc : the VALUE is treated as the full file name,
                            but allows the use of the usual wildcards (?*).
                     - Default: wc
              OPTION - One of {cs, ci} (case-insensitive)
                       cs : the PATTERN will be applied case-sensitive.
                       ci : the PATTERN will be applied case-insensitive.
                     - Default: ci
              VALUE  - A (constant) value to be applied to the METHOD along
                       with the (variable) filenames in question.
    PATH   - A path to be examined. Subdirectories are included if existing.
             Multiple PATHs can be examined.

[1] %2$s find 'myFile.jpg' path/to/images

    ... to find files named "myFile.jpg" in the directory "path/to/images"
        and its subdirectories.

[2] %2$s find '*.jpg' path/to/images

        "path/to/images" and its subdirectories.

[3] %2$s find 'myFile.*' path/to/images

    ... to find files whose names start with "myFile." in the directory
        "path/to/images" and its subdirectories.

[4] %2$s find 'rx:.*\.(jpg|jpe|jpeg)' images other/images more/images
