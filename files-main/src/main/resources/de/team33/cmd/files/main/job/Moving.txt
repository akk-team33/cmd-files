Expected request scheme:

    %2$s move [-r] PATH RULE

    ... to relocate all regular files located directly* in a given
    processing directory.

    *Optionally, regular files located in subdirectories are also processed.
    Empty subdirectories will finally be removed (see CLEAN).

Parameters:

    -r   - 'recursive' : A switch to also process normal files in
           subdirectories, if present. (case-insensitive)
    PATH - A path to the processing directory.
    RULE - A processing rule that has a similar structure to a relative path,
           but which can contain TOKENs that are interpreted during
           processing. A resulting relative path will be resolved from the
           processing directory!

           Tokens (case sensitive!):

           @Y -> the year the file in question was last modified.
           @M -> the month the file in question was last modified.
           @D -> the day the file in question was last modified.
           @h -> the hour the file in question was last modified.
           @m -> the minute the file in question was last modified.
           @s -> the second the file in question was last modified.
           @X -> the current filename extension of the file in question.
           @N -> the current filename without extension of the file in question.
           @F -> the current filename with extension of the file in question.
           @P -> the actual filename of the processing directory.
           @p -> the filename of the current parent directory of the file in
                 question.
           @# -> a hex encoded SHA1 hash value over the content of the file
                 in question. If the actual file name already contains such a
                 hash value, that value is used instead of recalculating it.
           @! -> a hex encoded time stamp of the last modification of the file
                 in question, accurate to a second. If the actual file name
                 already contains such a timestamp, that value is used instead
                 of recalculating it.
