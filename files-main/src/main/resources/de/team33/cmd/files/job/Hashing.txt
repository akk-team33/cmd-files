Expected request scheme:

    [1] %2$s hash -c init
    [2] %2$s hash [-p:PATTERN] PATH [PATH [...]]

Description:

[1] Initiate a runtime configuration: A file named "(files.hash).txt" in the
    current working directory preliminary containing default configuration
    values. You may later edit and so modify that configuration.

[2] 1. Determine an SHA-1 hash value and a short form of it for each regular
    file in the specified directories whose name corresponds to the specified
    (or predefined) pattern.

    2. Save the values together with other information about the respective
    file (file size, time of last modification) in a user-specific cache.

    3. Add the short form of the hash value to the file name of each affected
    file in order to be able to establish a relationship between the file and
    the data stored in the cache.

    4. Find potential duplicates of the affected files and finally list them.

    OPTIONAL: If specified accordingly in the runtime configuration,
    duplicates of the affected files are moved to a quarantine directory.

Parameters:

    PATTERN - Consists of [METHOD[/OPTION]:]VALUE
              METHOD - One of {rx, wc} (case-insensitive)
                       rx : the VALUE is treated as a regular expression.
                       wc : the VALUE is treated as the full file name,
                            but allows the use of the usual wildcards (?*).
                     - Default: wc
              OPTION - One of {cs, ci} (case-insensitive)
                       cs : the PATTERN will be applied case-sensitive.
                       ci : the PATTERN will be applied case-insensitive.
                     - Default: ci
              VALUE  - The value to be applied to the METHOD.
            - Default: As defined in the runtime configuration or else '*'.
    PATH    - A path to be examined. Subdirectories are included if existing.
              Multiple PATHs can be examined at once.
