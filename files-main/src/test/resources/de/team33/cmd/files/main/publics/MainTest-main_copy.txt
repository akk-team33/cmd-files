    MainTest copy

Expected request scheme:

    MainTest copy STRATEGY SRC_PATH TGT_PATH

    ... to recursively copy regular files and their relative file structure
        from a source directory to a target directory.

Parameters:

    STRATEGY - A combination of {C, U, O, R, D} (case-insensitive)
               C - 'create':   Copy an existing source file if it does not
                               already exist in the target directory.
               U - 'update':   Copy a source file if it is newer than the
                               corresponding target file.
               O - 'override': Copy a source file if it is the same age as the
                               corresponding target file but their size is
                               different (implies different content).
               R - 'revert':   Copy a source file though it is older than the
                               corresponding target file.
               D - 'delete':   Delete an existing target file if it does not
                               exist in the source directory.
    SRC_PATH - The path to the source directory.
    TGT_PATH - The path to the target directory.

Examples:

[1] MainTest copy cu path/to/source path/to/target

    ... to recursively copy regular files and their relative file structure
        from 'path/to/source' to 'path/to/target' if they do not already exist
        in the target directory or if they are newer than the corresponding
        target file.

[2] MainTest copy UcDRo path/to/source path/to/target

    ... to recursively copy regular files and their relative file structure
        from 'path/to/source' to 'path/to/target', regardless of whether
        corresponding files exist in the destination or not, as well as to
        delete files from 'path/to/target' if no corresponding files exist in
        the source.%n%n
