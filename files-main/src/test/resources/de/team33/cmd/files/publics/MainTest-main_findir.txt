Expected request scheme:

    MainTest findir PATTERN PATH [PATH [...]]

    ... to find directories containing files whose file names match a specific
        search pattern.

Parameters:

    PATTERN - Consists of [METHOD[/OPTION]:]VALUE
              METHOD - One of {rx, wc} (case-insensitive)
                       rx : the VALUE is treated as a regular expression.
                       wc : the VALUE is treated as the full file name,
                            but allows the use of the usual wildcards (?*).
                     - Default: wc
              OPTION - One of {cs, ci} (case-insensitive)
                       cs : the PATTERN will be applied case-sensitive.
                       ci : the PATTERN will be applied case-insensitive.
                     - Default: ci
              VALUE  - A (constant) value to be applied to the METHOD along
                       with the (variable) filenames in question.
    PATH   - A path to be examined. Subdirectories are included if existing.
             Multiple PATHs can be examined.

Examples:

[1] MainTest findir 'myFile.jpg' path/to/images

    ... to find directories containing files named "myFile.jpg" in the
        directory "path/to/images" and its subdirectories.

[2] MainTest findir '*.jpg' path/to/images

    ... to find directories containing files whose names end with ".jpg" in
        the directory "path/to/images" and its subdirectories.

[3] MainTest findir 'myFile.*' path/to/images

    ... to find directories containing files whose names start with "myFile."
        in the directory "path/to/images" and its subdirectories.

[4] MainTest findir 'rx:.*\.(jpg|jpe|jpeg)' images other/images more/images

    ... to find directories containing files with any of the extensions
        {"jpg", "jpe", "jpeg"} within the directories "images", "other/images"
        and "more/images" and their subdirectories.%n%n
